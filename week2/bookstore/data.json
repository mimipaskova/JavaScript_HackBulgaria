If Death doesn&apos;t come for you, then what are you supposed to do in the meantime? You can't have the undead wandering about like lost souls. There's no telling what might happen, particularly when they discover that life really is only for the living...","authors":{"author":{"id":1654,"name":"Terry Pratchett","image_url":"https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1235562205p5/1654.jpg","small_image_url":"https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1235562205p2/1654.jpg","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1654.Terry_Pratchett","average_rating":4.1,"ratings_count":1903517,"text_reviews_count":55041}},"published":{}},{"id":{"type":"integer","$t":34532},"isbn":552154288,"isbn13":9780552154284,"text_reviews_count":{"type":"integer","$t":570},"title":"Hogfather &amp;&#35;40;Discworld, #20&#41;","image_url":"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327948141m/34532.jpg","small_image_url":"https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327948141s/34532.jpg","link":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34532.Hogfather","num_pages":432,"format":"Paperback","edition_information":{},"publisher":"Corgi","publication_day":2,"publication_year":2006,"publication_month":10,"average_rating":4.16,"ratings_count":37227,"description":"&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Susan had never hung up a stocking .
