# Image loading UI

Now, we are going to make something more complicated. We are going to load images from urls and place them into our application.

Open `index.html` and you will see the search input and the button already there.

__You have to do the following:__

* When the user inputs a url and clicks the button - fetch the image and place it under the controls
* Images should accumulate on the page - don't remove the image if the users loads another one
* If the users clicks on the image - the image should be removed from the page
* If the URL is invalid or something fails to load - be sure to notifty the user about that

This is a task that requires google-search skills ;)
