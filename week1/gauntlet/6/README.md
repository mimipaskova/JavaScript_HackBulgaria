# Moving items between lists

Open `index.html` - you will see two select menus.

The first one is populated with some items, while the second one is empty.


You have to implement the following:

* __Use a server__ (Either the one with students or create one yourslef) to populate the items in the first select menu!
* When the user selects one or more items and clicks on the `-->` button, move the items to the second select menu. Remove them from the first.
* When the user selects items from the second menu and clicks on the `<--` button, move the items from the second select to the first, while removing them from the second one.

You can select multiple items from the menu, by holding the `shift` key.
