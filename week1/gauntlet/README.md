# The jQuery Gauntlet!

We are going to execute a few very simple tasks in order to start understanding what is happening in the Frontend World, The DOM world and the jQuery world.

Few important notes:

* Tasks are in folders, starting from `1` (This is the first task)
* Each folder have `bower.json` file - run `bower install` before starting with the task
* Each task has it's own separate `README.md` file for better understanding.

It is a good idea to check the [materials for week 1](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Frontend-JavaScript-1/blob/master/week1/materials.md) before starting :)

Good luck with the gauntlet! May JavaScript be with you.
