# Hello World! (when the document is ready)

You have to take the first steps in every frontend app:

* Connect `jQuery` - located in `bower_components` to the `index.html` file
* Connect `app.js` to the `index.html` file
* Alert a message, using `alert(message)`, when the document is ready!

In order to understand wether the document is ready or not, we can use:

```javascript
$(document).ready(someCallback);
```
